    Founder's Letter,2012

Facebook was not originally created to be a company.It was built to accomplish a social mission -- to make the world more open and connected.

We think it's important that everyone who invests in Facebook understands what this mission means to us,how we make decisions and why we do the things we do.I will try to outline our approach in this letter.
